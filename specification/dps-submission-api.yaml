  title: DPS Submission Api
  description: |
    ## Overview
    Use this API to submit data to DPS.

    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest-apis). And is available via the Internet, and over the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network). It also conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/introduction-to-apis#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange. Specifically, it is aligned with [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core), which is built on FHIR Release 4.

    ## Authorisation
    This API is [Application-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#application-restricted-apis) which means the calling application is authenticated rather than the end user. This API requires an API key presented in the 'apiKey' header along with the request.
